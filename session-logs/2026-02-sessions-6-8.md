## 2026-02-17 (Session 6) — Claude Code & OpenClaw Process Improvements

### What was worked on

1. **Populated auto memory (MEMORY.md)** — Extracted key learnings from 5 sessions into persistent memory: critical gotchas, database patterns, testing patterns, performance insights, user preferences

2. **Created `.env.example`** — Documents required environment variables without exposing secrets

3. **Added deny rules for destructive commands** — `~/.claude/settings.json` now blocks `rm -rf`, `git push --force`, `git reset --hard`, `git checkout .`, `git clean -f`

4. **Created `.claude/rules/` with path-specific rules** — 4 rule files that load contextually:
   - `api.md` — API route conventions (loaded for `src/app/api/**`)
   - `testing.md` — Test patterns (loaded for `*.test.ts` and `src/test/**`)
   - `bot.md` — Bot-specific rules (loaded for `src/app/api/bot/**`)
   - `components.md` — Component conventions (loaded for `*.tsx` files)

5. **Added PostToolUse formatting hook** — Auto-runs `eslint --fix` on `.ts/.tsx/.js/.jsx/.mjs` files after Edit/Write operations

6. **Split CLAUDE.md into focused files** — 203 lines down to ~65 lines:
   - `CLAUDE.md` — Concise actionable instructions with `@imports`
   - `ARCHITECTURE.md` — Full reference for pages, API, database, components
   - `OPERATIONS.md` — Deployment, OpenClaw, watchdog, sleep prevention

7. **Archived old sessions** — Sessions 1-4 moved to `session-logs/2026-02-sessions-1-4.md`. SESSION_LOG.md now keeps only the last 5 sessions.

### Key decisions

- **Split CLAUDE.md using `@imports`** — keeps the system prompt lean while making reference docs available on demand
- **Path-specific rules over monolithic instructions** — bot rules don't load when editing components, reducing context noise
- **eslint --fix as PostToolUse hook** — deterministic formatting that always runs, unlike advisory instructions
- **Deny rules for destructive git commands** — safety net even in bypassPermissions mode
- **Session archiving at 5 sessions** — keeps SESSION_LOG.md readable while preserving history

### Discoveries

- Claude Code auto memory was empty after 5 sessions — needs explicit population
- Project had no `.claude/settings.json` — needed for project-level hooks and rules
- No prettier configured — eslint is the only formatting tool
- `@import` syntax in CLAUDE.md lets you reference other files without duplicating content

### Next steps

- Flesh out profile page
- Add rate limiting to bot API
- Consider `create_issue` bot action
- Set up GitHub Actions CI
- Consider upgrading OpenClaw (`v2026.2.15` available)

## 2026-02-17 (Session 7) — Developer Best Practices & Sentry

### What was worked on

This was a large "hardening" session — implementing developer best practices across the entire codebase, then adding Sentry error monitoring.

**Round 1 — Developer best practices (implemented all at once):**

1. **Zod validation** on all API mutation routes
2. **Rate limiting** on all mutation endpoints — sliding-window in-memory limiter
3. **CSP header** in `src/middleware.ts`
4. **Cache headers** on GET API routes via middleware
5. **npm audit** in GitHub Actions CI
6. **Prettier** — `.prettierrc` config, `format`/`format:check` scripts
7. **eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y** — promoted 6 key rules to error level
8. **`.editorconfig`**
9. **`.env.example` expansion**
10. **`CONTRIBUTING.md`**
11. **GitHub templates** — PR template, bug report template, feature request template

**Round 2 — Sentry error monitoring:**

12-16. Installed `@sentry/nextjs`, error boundaries, Next.js integration, Sentry account setup, Vercel env vars

### Test count

215 tests passing across 13 files (~1.3s)

## 2026-02-17 (Session 8) — UUID Migration + Scaling Architecture

### What was worked on

Complete migration of all database IDs from `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT` to `TEXT PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT (lower(hex(randomblob(16))))`. This was a 10-phase change across 35+ files.

Also created **`SCALING-ARCHITECTURE.md`** — comprehensive scaling document.

### Key decisions

- **32-char hex UUIDs** — `crypto.randomUUID().replace(/-/g, '')` matches SQLite's format
- **Readable test IDs** — `'issue-rail'` instead of random UUIDs for test determinism
- **`_migrations` keeps AUTOINCREMENT** — internal tooling, no API surface

### Test count

230 tests passing across 17 files (~1.4s)
