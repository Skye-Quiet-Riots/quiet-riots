# Quiet Riots

Bringing the *Quiet Riots* book to life.

Quiet Riots is a platform for organising people around shared issues and enabling collective action. It's built on the belief that meaningful change doesn't always start with loud protest — sometimes it begins with people quietly finding each other, aligning on what matters, and acting together.
